# Uber_New-York-Data-Analysis


To prepare the data for analysis, I performed several tasks. Firstly, I determined the month with the highest number of Uber pickups. 

By analyzing the dataset, I identified that [month] had the most significant pickup activity, providing valuable insights into the usage patterns.

Furthermore, I calculated the total number of trips for each month and each weekday. 

This analysis helped me understand the distribution of Uber trips throughout the months and weekdays, highlighting any variations or trends.

Moving on, I examined the hourly rush in New York City across all days. By analyzing the data, I determined the peak hours when Uber pickups were most prevalent, 

giving an understanding of the city's transportation demands during different times of the day.

Additionally, I investigated which base number had the highest number of active vehicles. By analyzing the dataset, 

I discovered that [base number] had the most significant fleet of active vehicles, indicating its dominance in the Uber market.

To illustrate the distribution of pickups more visually, I utilized a geographical heatmap to identify the rush locations within New York City. 

This analysis provided a clear visualization of the hotspots where Uber pickups were most concentrated, helping to identify areas with high demand.

Finally, I examined the rush hour trends on an hourly and weekday basis. I grouped the data by hour and weekday, and then employed a pivot heatmap to visualize the 

rush hour patterns. This allowed me to identify the busiest hours and the days of the week with the highest demand for Uber rides.

Overall, through these analytical steps, I was able to gain comprehensive insights into the Uber pickup data and understand the patterns, 

trends, and geographical distribution of demand in New York City.
